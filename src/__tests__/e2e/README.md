# End-to-End Tests

This directory contains end-to-end tests using Playwright.

## Running Tests

npx playwright test
```

## Test Structure

Tests should be organized by feature or user flow. For example:

- `auth.spec.ts` - Authentication flows
- `chat.spec.ts` - Chat interaction flows
- `settings.spec.ts` - Settings management

## Implementation Status

End-to-end tests will be implemented in a later phase of the project.
